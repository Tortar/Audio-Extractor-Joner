# Audio-Extractor&Joner

Are you tired to listen to powerpoint audios at normal speed or to extract audio files from it manually to speed them up? 
This script extracts and joins audio files in a single file .wav for each powerpoint in the same folder of the script : you can easily speed up the audio from here. 

<b>Tecnical details </b>

Make sure to have installed pydub, shutil and zipfile modules on your computer.
You can install them via commands prompt with :
<figure><pre><code> - pip install name_module </code></pre></figure>

You need also to download [ffmpeg software](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add the absolute path of the <code>\bin</code> folder to the windows environment variables under the python path.
