# Audio-Extractor&Joner

Are you tired to listen to powerpoints audio at normal speed or to extract audio files from it manually? 
This script extracts and joins audio files from powerpoints in a single file wav : you can easily speed up the audio from here. 

<b>Tecnical details :</b>

Put all the powerpoints in the same folder of the script. 
The file new_slide.wav (bell sound) is used as a separator from one slide to the other. 
Make sure to have installed pydub, shutil and zipfile modules on your computer.
