# Audio-Extractor-Joner
The script extracts and joins audio files from powerpoints in a single file wav. Put all the powerpoints in the same folder of the script. 
The file new_slide.wav (bell sound) is used as a separator from one slide to the other. Make sure to have installed 
pydub, shutil and zipfile modules on your computer.
